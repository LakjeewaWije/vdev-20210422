6. Node js is event-driven single threaded javascript runtime environment. Which executes events one after another rather 
   than having mulitple threads to execute funtions.Recieving a request is considered an event, if there's a blocking IO operation it doesn't wait until it stops but registeres a call back function. In the low level (C ++ code) there's pool of IO workers which recieve IO Interrupts and put corresponding events into the queue to be processed by the main thread which prevents main thread being inturrupted.
7. A web platform is a power online platoform which is a collection of code written in some programming language that is used to generate the dynamic web pages that   make up a website. It consits of many tools like and services like ,
            # Social Media integration

8. Typescipt is the superscript of Javascript that works by compiling typescript to javascript by typescript compiler.
9. WebAssembly is needed to get the high end performance to run various tasks which is hard to gain by javascript alone. If a code is written in native language like C,C++ it should need a tool to compile it to WebAssembly module along with javascript file and html file and then js file can be used communicate with the Webassembly module and display the output in the html.
10. Fastify is nearly 20% as fast as Express but fails to express when handling empty requests. Also Express has stronger community support.
11. TailWind has lot of classes to use than of Bootstrap / Also set hover, active and focus states using classes / Tailwind CSS only requires the base stylesheet file but bootstrap needs 4 files.
12. It can use ES Modules instead of a fully bundled application.This allows the app to render only the required code , rather than everything.
